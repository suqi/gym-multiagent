# gym-sandbox
Customize your own gym environment to simulate any RL problem you want to solve.

## Philosophy
Divide and Conquer.
- Divide complex real problem into clean focused sub-tasks, and conquer by each.

Pipeline.
- Integrate your solutions of all sub-tasks.

## Origin
We want to solve complex games, like StarCraft, SuperMario, etc.
However, these games contains many sub-tasks, if we can't solve one, we can't solve the whole.
So we must ensure we can solve each sub-task, and then we have the confidence to solve all.

## Features

- Bokeh
